# Python: Almost a circle


In this project, I leveraged my expertise in Python's object-oriented programming paradigm to create a cohesive system comprised of three interconnected classes designed to model rectangles and squares. My implementation includes comprehensive unit tests utilizing the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness and robustness of each class's functionality.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:
- Import
- Exceptions
- Private attributes
- Getter/setter
- Class/static methods
- Inheritance
- File I/O
- args/kwargs
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Unittesting

## Tests ✔️
- [tests/test_models](tests/test_models): Folder containing the following independently-developed test files:
  - [test_base.py](tests/test_models/test_base.py)
  - [test_rectangle.py](tests/test_models/test_rectangle.py)
  - [test_square.py](tests/test_models/test_square.py)
