# Python: Inheritance

This folder contains Python scripts illustrating the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, facilitating code reuse and creating hierarchical relationships between classes. The scripts demonstrate how to define parent and child classes, utilize inheritance to extend functionality and explore the benefits of polymorphism.
